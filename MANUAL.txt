CHAPTER 1: Formatting
If your text file has thrown an Error 1, your file is formatted incorrectly. Here is the correct way to format your file:
1) Make sure that the first line of the file has 2 newlines after it.
2) A newline creates a linebreak <br> tag.
3) Two consecutive newlines end the current paragraph with </p> and open a new one with <p>.

Chapter 2: Configuration
TTH has a few configuration options, and each has a dedicated line to put it on. If you do not wish to assign an option, start the line with a '#' or just leave it blank.
Line 1) This is the filepath for the CSS file you want to use. If the HTML file will be used on a web server, this path should be relative to the site root or the file itself, rather than the system root.
